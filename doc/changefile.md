# Change Files

There are two types of data files related to changes in the map
data. These files contain all the changes made during a time interval,
every moinute, hour, or daily data files are available from the
OpenStreetMap [planet](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/)
server. 

There are two different formats of change data, one for changesets,
and the other for the actual changes. Both are needed for filtering
changes to produce statistics.

## Changeset

A changeset file contains only the data about the change, and not the
actual change itself. It contains the data of the change at the time
it's uploaded to OpenStreetMap. Each change has an action; create,
delete, modify. Each action then contains the changed objects in the
action. As this file contains the data created when uploading it to
OpenStreetMap, it's the only way to access the commit hashtags or
comments. 

As hashtags didnâ€™t exist until late 2014, and between 2014 and 2017,
hashtag were contained in the comment field. In 2017, the official
hashtag tag was added. A typical changefile entry looks like this:

	<changeset id="12345" created_at="2014-10-10T01:57:09Z" closed_at="2014-10-10T01:57:23Z" open="false" user="foo" uid="54321" min_lat="-2.8042325" min_lon="29.5842812" max_lat="-2.7699398" max_lon="29.6012844" num_changes="569" comments_count="0">
	    <tag k="source" v="Bing"/>
	    <tag k="comment" v="#hotosm-task-001 #redcross #missingmaps"/>
	    <tag k="created_by" v="JOSM/1.5 (7182 en)"/>
	</changeset>

The **created_by** and **source** fields can be used to generate
statistics of editor choices and imagery sources. Underpass uses only
the comment and hashtag fields currently as a way to group sets of
changes by organization, or mapping campaign.

## OsmChange

And OsmChange file contains the data of the actual change. It uses the
same syntax as an OSM data file plus the addition of one of the three
actions. Nodes, ways, and relations can be created, deleted, or
modified. Multiple OSM object types can be in the same action. As this
data contains the actual change, it is used to filter by tag, or used
to do calculations, like the length of roads added.
